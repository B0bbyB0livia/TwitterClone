# TwitterClone
Based on Core principles of Twitter but different in many ways.

Hey there, 

  This repository contains the clone of Twitter. 
  However, only the core principles of Twitter are same.
  
  This site is visually very different and is basically my approach to build a relatively complex website like Twitter.
  
  I've used MVC Framework to build this website.
  
  I've used Bootstrap to develop this project. [More about Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
  
**What is MVC?**

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.

##Features
